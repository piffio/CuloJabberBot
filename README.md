INTRODUCTION
============

This is CuloJabberBot, a bot I'm working on mainly as
a hobby project for practicing with some Python.

It's based on the "JabberBot" framework.
The original sources for the framework is available on
the project website

http://thp.io/2007/python-jabberbot/

I also have a cloned copy of their repository available in my
github, at this URL

GOAL
====

The idea is to build a general purpose Jabber Bot that enables you
to control a Transmission server via Jabber.
Eventually other features will be added in the future.


REQUIREMENTS
============

The both relies on the following projects / modules:

- JabberBot (see introduction)

- TransmissionRPC (http://packages.python.org/transmissionrpc/)

The code is tested with Python 2.7 running on Debian Testing
